<h2>Creates 1-dimensional contingency tables - potentially disclosive data are suppressed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functionds.table1d is a client-side wrapper function.
It calls the server-side subfunction table1d.ds to
generate 1-dimensional tables for all data sources. Valid
(non-disclosive) data are defined as data from sources
where no table cells have counts between 1 and 4 (the
upper value [4] can in principle be changed but only by
rewriting the underlying function - it cannot be changed
by a standard DataSHIELD user). If the count in any cell
in the table produced by a given data source IS invalid,
that cell count is changed to &quot;-1&quot; and the name of the
category in which it falls is changed to &quot;-9&quot;. Each
source is flagged as having only valid data, or at least
some invalid data. The functionds.table1d prints out
tables of study against xvect category detailing: counts;
column percents; row percents; and global percents. The
final column represents all valid studies combined.
Missing data are treated as na.action=na.omit (default
for table function), if missing data are to be treated as
a separate and visible category, the variable should
first be transformed to convert NAs to the a new value.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  ds.table1d(datasources = NULL, xvect = NULL,
    type = "combine")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of opal object(s) obtained
after login in to opal servers; these objects hold also
the data assign to R, as <code>dataframe</code>, from opal
datasources.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xvect</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numerical vector with discrete values -
usually a factor as well as the tables representing only
the valid data. If TRUE then only outputs the valid
data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character which represent the type of graph
to display. If <code>type</code> is set to 'combine', a
histogram that merges the single plot is displayed. Each
histogram is plotted separately if If <code>type</code> is set
to 'split'.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object (eg. named out.obj) containing the
following items: </p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>OPALS.DATA.OVERVIEW</code></td>
<td>
<p>For each
study contains $study.name (ie name of study),
$is.table.valid (TRUE if all cells valid otherwise
FALSE), $safe.table (the safe contingency table that
contains all cells if all are valid, but otherwise
obscures invalid cells by outputting a cell count of &quot;-1&quot;
and making the two category indicators for that cell =
&quot;-9&quot;. In other words OPALS.DATA.OVERVIEW provides the
information generated by the server side
subfunctiontable1d.ds on its own.</p>
</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td><code>VALIDITY.WARNING
- IF NEEDED</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either reports that all studies are valid,
or else lists the studies that contain at least one cell
that is invalid, or else reports &quot;NO STUDIES HAVE VALID
DATA - SO NO ATTEMPT TO COMBINE&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.COUNTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cell counts, for each
study separately and for all valid studies combined</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.COLUMN.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Column percents,
for each study separately and for all valid studies
combined</p>
</td></tr> <tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.ROW.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Row
percents, for each study separately and for all valid
studies combined</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>TABLES.VALID.DATA.GLOBAL.PERCENTS</code></td>
<td>
<p>Global percents,
for each study separately and for all valid studies
combined</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
{
# load the file that contains the login details
data(logindata)

# login and assign the required variables to R
myvar  &lt;-  list("DIS_CVA","LAB_HDL")
opals  &lt;-  datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

# Example 1: generate a one dimensional table, outputting combined contingency tables
ds.table1d(datasources=opals, xvect=quote(D$DIS_CVA))

# Example 2: generate a one dimensional table, outputting study specific contingency tables
ds.table1d(datasources=opals, xvect=quote(D$DIS_CVA), type="split")

# Example 3: generate a one dimensional table, outputting study specific contingency tables for study 1 and 2
ds.table1d(datasources=opals[1:2], xvect=quote(D$DIS_CVA), type="split")

# Example 4: generate a one dimensional table, outputting study specific and combined contingency tables, see what happens if
# you try to tabulate a quantitative variable with unique values for many individuals. The standard \code{table} function in R would print out
# all observed 'values' as category names in ascending order with a count (generally 1) for each unique number, butds.table1d prints
# out all values where there are between 1 and 4 observations as -1 and gives the category name -9. It is only when the count is
# 5 or more that the actual value can be observed, and then it is non-disclosive
ds.table1d(datasources=opals, xvect=quote(D$LAB_HDL))
