DataSHIELD ([Wolfson et al., 2010](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/5/1372.abstract)) is a novel method that enables a pooled data analysis to be carried out across several collaborating studies as if one had full access to all of the data from individual participants that might be needed, but, in reality, these data remain completely secure on their host computer at the home base of the study where they were collected or generated. DataSHIELD therefore permits a fully efficient pooled analysis to be undertaken of biomedical data from several studies, even when ethico-legal or other governance restrictions prohibit the release of individual-level data to third parties.
